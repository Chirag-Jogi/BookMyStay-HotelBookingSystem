BookMyStay is a web development project designed to simulate an online hotel booking experience. The system allows users to register on the website, fill out a booking form, and receive a booking confirmation. Although the project does not include actual hotel room reservations or cancellation options, it successfully stores user booking data in a database for record-keeping.

Key Features:

1.User Registration: Allows users to create an account by registering on the platform.
2.Booking Form: Users can fill out a booking form with their stay details, including check-in, check-out dates, room type, and number of guests.
3.Payment Simulation: After submitting the booking form, a loading page simulates the payment process, leading to a "Booking Successful" confirmation after a brief delay.
4.Database Integration: Utilized SQL to store user registration and booking details, ensuring that all data is recorded and retrievable.
Tools & Technologies:

1.Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
2.Back-End: Java, JDBC
3.Database: SQL
4.Tools: Ecllipse IDM
