BookMyStay is a web development project designed to simulate an online hotel booking experience. The system allows users to register on the website, fill out a booking form, and receive a booking confirmation. Although the project does not include actual hotel room reservations or cancellation options, it successfully stores user booking data in a database for record-keeping.

Key Features:

User Registration: Allows users to create an account by registering on the platform.
Booking Form: Users can fill out a booking form with their stay details, including check-in, check-out dates, room type, and number of guests.
Payment Simulation: After submitting the booking form, a loading page simulates the payment process, leading to a "Booking Successful" confirmation after a brief delay.
Database Integration: Utilized SQL to store user registration and booking details, ensuring that all data is recorded and retrievable.
Tools & Technologies:

Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Back-End: Java, JDBC
Database: SQL
Tools: Ecllipse IDM
